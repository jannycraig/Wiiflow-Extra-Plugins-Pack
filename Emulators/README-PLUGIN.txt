Neko Project II Plugin 0.1
--------------------------

- Based on this pc98 emulator(0.83 beta 6) : http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Neko_Project_II
- Original 640x400 resolution and the screen is centered.

PC98 bios files are required for better results: bios.rom, itf.rom and bios9821.rom (for np21.dol) must be copied in the /roms/PC98 folder
Game roms must be copied to /roms/PC98/01 folder (for 9801 roms) or /roms/PC98/21 folder (for 9821 roms)

Some games need the GDC set to 2.5 Mhz in the bios. To access the bios, you need to hold "End" key on the usb keyboard, when the emulator starts.

Np21.dol is for pc9821 games (the first Touhou games for ex.). The emulation is slow for theses games though.
In fact, the emulator is globally a bit slow. Not a problem for the numerous erotic adventure, board or quiz games. But for the rare good shoot'em up...
