#How to set up

 when pointing monitor.

In vertical mode, you can see the system setup menu when you reset np2 with holding pressing wiimote minus button.
But the language of the system setup menu is Japanese because the messages are originated from PC-9801.

See the graphical information of contros in
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Neko_Project_II

You can configurate the allocations from keyboard keys to wiimote buttons by editing /np2/np2.cfg file (no user interface).
If you want to change the allocations, change the numbers of wpad_button_? (?=a, b, plus, minus, 1, 2, right, left, down, up, fleft, and fright) according to the numbers in key_numnerlist.txt file.

#Known issues 
1) When running for the first time, this emulator will automatically convert the true-type font (default.ttf), sazanami free font, to font.tmp. This conversion makes you wait for several minutes.
But, once it has completed the conversion, this emulator does not make you wait. If you want to use another font, delete /np2/font.tmp and /np2/default.ttf, and copy your favorite true-type font to /np2 directory as 'default.ttf'. 
2) The game roms can be selected only in /np2/.(Because of libfat .....,and my poor programming ability ;-)
3) The bottom of screen is black (640x80).
(Bacause SDL library support the popular size (640x480) perfectly,
 but NEC traditional size (640x400) maybe be not well supported.)

#Others
np21.dol: Please guess what this executable file is. The np21 emulates 80386 CPU while the np emulates 80286 CPU. The np21 may execute some games that cannot be exuecuted by np2.
